              <h4>What We Believe</h4>
              <p>A church building, church house, or simply church, is a building used for Christian worship services and other
                Christian religious activities. The term is used to refer to the physical buildings where Christians worship and
                also to refer to the community of Christians.</p>

            <h4>Who We Are</h4>
            <p>Sometimes it is used as an analogy for the buildings of other
                religions.In traditional Christian architecture the plan view of a church often forms a Christian cross; the
                center aisle and seating representing the vertical beam with the bema and altar forming the horizontal. Towers
                or domes may inspire contemplation of the heavens. Modern churches have a variety of architectural styles and
                layouts. Some buildings designed for other purposes have been converted to churches, while many original church
                buildings have been put to other uses.</p>

            <h4>How We Live</h4>
            <p>The earliest identified Christian church building is a house church founded between 233 and 256. From the 11th
                through the 14th centuries there was a wave of church construction in western Europe. A cathedral is a church
                building housing a cathedra, the seat or throne of a presiding bishop.</p>

            <h2>Morning Gathering</h2>
            <p>In Roman Catholic churches there is always a stoup (bowl) of holy water near the entrance of the church.
                This tradition comes from the fact that Roman basilicas had a fountain for washing in front of the
                entrance. The font is a bowl where people (often babies) are baptized. This is also near the entrance of
                the church. This is a symbol of the fact that it is welcoming the people into the Christian church.</p>

            <h2>Spirit and Truth</h2>
            <p>Traditionally the nave has long benches for the congregation to sit on. These are called pews. Some
                churches may now have replaced their pews with chairs so that they can be moved about for different
                occasions. At the front of the nave is the pulpit where the priest preaches (these talks are called
                “sermons”). There is also a lectern (like a large music stand) from where the lessons (the Bible
                readings) are read.</p>

            <h2>Sunday School</h2>
            <p>If there are aisles along the side of the nave there will be pillars which hold up the roof. In large
                churches or cathedrals there may be a row of little arches along the top of these pillars. This is
                called the triforium. Over the triforium is the clerestory which is a row of windows high up in the
                church wall.</p>
